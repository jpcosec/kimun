# Semantic query hint

## Answer

A semantic query hint is a semantic-layer aid that helps retrieval or projection systems interpret likely conceptual matches or neighborhoods.

## Supporting points

- It is an aid to semantic retrieval, not canonical truth.
- It can remain lightweight in the initial system.
- It supports richer semantic search later.
