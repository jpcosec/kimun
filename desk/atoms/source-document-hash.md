# Source document hash

## Answer

A source document hash is the source-file hash stored with an anchor so the system can detect changes in the anchored external document.

## Supporting points

- It supports change detection across external files.
- It is one of the mandatory evidentiary anchor fields.
- It complements sample text and locators.
