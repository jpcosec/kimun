# Golden fixture

## Answer

A golden fixture is a pinned input/output artifact set used to prove that canonicalization, hashing, rendering, diffs, or query behavior has not changed unexpectedly.

## Supporting points

- A fixture should include source input plus the expected canonical and rendered outputs relevant to the contract.
- Golden fixtures are especially important for reversible document families and regression-heavy command surfaces.
- Fixture changes are product-truth changes, not incidental test churn.
