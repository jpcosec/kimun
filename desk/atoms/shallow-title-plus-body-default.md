# Shallow `title + body` default

## Answer

For heterogeneous narrative documents, the recommended default is a shallow `title + body` model unless richer typed structure is truly needed.

## Supporting points

- This is the documented authoring default for many real-world docs.
- It keeps modeling lightweight where deep structure is unnecessary.
- The refactor should preserve this practical modeling guidance.
