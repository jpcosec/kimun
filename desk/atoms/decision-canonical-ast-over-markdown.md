# Decision: canonical AST over Markdown

## Answer

The refactor treats the canonical AST as sovereign because Markdown is too surface-bound to carry the full stable identity, relation, anchoring, hashing, and graph semantics that the target architecture needs.

## Supporting points

- Markdown remains important as an authoring and projection surface, but not as the ontological center.
- Stable node identity, typed relations, anchors, and derived indexes need a canonical internal substrate.
- This decision keeps renderers and importers replaceable without changing the core truth model.
