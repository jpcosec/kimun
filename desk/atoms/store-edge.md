# Store edge

## Answer

A store edge is the canonical edge type that records store-level relationships between ASTs in the graph store.

## Supporting points

- It is part of how the store connects canonical units.
- It belongs to the graph store rather than the rendered document surface.
- It helps express graph-native store semantics.

### 5WH1+ neighborhood

- This atom is typed by its `five_wh_one_plus` field and should be queried together with nearby `what`/`how`/`when`/`where` atoms rather than as an isolated note.
