# Addressability layer

## Answer

The addressability layer gives canonical units stable paths, selectors, anchors, aliases, and targetable identities across projections.

## Supporting points

- It is the basis for linking, inspection, graph traversal, and visual targeting.
- It must survive changes in materialization or surface representation.
- It sits close to the canonical structure rather than as a late add-on.
