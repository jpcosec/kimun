# Lisp schema language

## Answer

The Lisp schema language is an authored input surface used to define inspectable schema and model contracts that the Rust kernel validates and interprets.

## Supporting points

- Lisp schema forms describe structure and constraints without becoming canonical persistence by themselves.
- Schema meaning is owned by the Rust kernel, not by a standalone Lisp runtime.
- Authored schema forms are inputs; any exported Lisp form later emitted from canonical state is a materialization.
- Schema forms should remain translatable to other surfaces without changing kernel truth.
