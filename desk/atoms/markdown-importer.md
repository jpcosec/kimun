# Markdown importer

## Answer

The Markdown importer translates the Markdown text surface into Clojure-owned canonical structure without making Markdown the sovereign model.

## Supporting points

- Markdown remains a key authoring and migration input surface.
- Markdown is input projection, not kernel authority.
- This importer is likely part of the first safe vertical slice.
- It preserves compatibility of user workflows while changing internals deeply.
