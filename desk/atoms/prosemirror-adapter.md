# ProseMirror adapter

## Answer

The ProseMirror adapter projects canonical structure into an editing-oriented structured document model for rich visual interaction.

## Supporting points

- ProseMirror is useful as a projection and editing substrate.
- It is not the canonical AST or the main store.
- It should sit downstream of canonical structure.
