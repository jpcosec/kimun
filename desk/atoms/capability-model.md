# Capability model

## Answer

The capability model is the explicit permission system that governs external effects, adapters, macros, hooks, agents, and other non-trivial kernel actions.

## Supporting points

- Filesystem, Git, network, process, and agent invocation must be declared and validated explicitly.
- Capabilities belong to plans and effects, not to implicit tclojure in one client implementation.
- Capability checks are part of the kernel contract for safe automation.
