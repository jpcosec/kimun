# Reference behavior

## Answer

Reference behavior is the normative expected result for a kernel operation, independent of one library stack, host adapter, or storage backend.

## Supporting points

- It is the behavior that conformance cases attest, not one implementation's incidental internals.
- Reference behavior must cover canonical state, revision results, hashes, and rendered outputs where the contract requires them.
- Backends and adapters may vary internally as long as reference behavior stays fixed.
