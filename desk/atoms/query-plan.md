# Query plan

## Answer

A query plan is the explicit intermediate representation of retrieval intent before the kernel executes structural, historical, logical, or semantic lookup.

## Supporting points

- Query plans keep host syntax separate from kernel evaluation semantics.
- They should bind revision context, filters, traversal shape, and output expectations.
- Query planning prevents one client DSL from becoming hidden query authority.
