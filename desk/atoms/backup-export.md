# Backup export

## Answer

A backup export is the backend-independent package of canonical transactions, revisions, payloads, schemas, versions, and hashes needed to preserve and move a repository safely.

## Supporting points

- Export must not depend on one storage engine's internal format.
- Export should be suitable for import, verify, rebuild-indexes, and disaster recovery flows.
- Backup/export boundaries belong to canonical persistence, not only to operational tooling.
