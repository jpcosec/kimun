# Python patterns

## Answer

Python patterns define the reusable implementation shapes for CLI orchestration, model-facing workflows, migration layers, and user-facing tooling around the canonical core.

## Supporting points

- Python should preserve the recognizable SLDB CLI and workflow ergonomics.
- Patterns here should favor thin orchestration, explicit contracts, low duplication, and clear boundaries around the Rust core.
- These patterns should keep user behavior stable while internals evolve.
