# Python CLI orchestration layer

## Answer

The Python CLI orchestration layer is an optional client shell that drives the kernel through public APIs without owning canonical state or persistence semantics.

## Supporting points

- Python is no longer the defining boundary of the architecture; it is one adapter alongside embedded Clojure, local IPC, HTTP, or agent-facing protocols.
- It may preserve command continuity and workflow ergonomics, but all authoritative mutations still compile to kernel transaction plans.
- Python should not define identity, revision semantics, hashing, canonicalization, or storage layout.
- Any Python integration should sit behind the same kernel API and capability rules as other clients.
