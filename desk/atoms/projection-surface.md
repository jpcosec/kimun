# Projection surface

## Answer

A projection surface is a user-facing derived view that exposes selected, reorganized, or interpreted canonical kernel/database state.

## Supporting points

- Semantic views, structural views, graph inspectors, and other specialized derived views are projection surfaces.
- Generic rendered outputs such as Markdown, HTML, JSON, or API payloads should be described as materializations rather than as projection surfaces unless a doc needs both terms explicitly.
- Projection surfaces never become authority.
- Translation between surfaces must preserve Clojure-owned meaning where the contract requires it.
