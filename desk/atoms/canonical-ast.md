# Canonical AST

## Answer

The canonical AST is the structural source of truth for authored document families and a shared substrate inside the refactored kernel's canonical graph/revision model.

## Supporting points

- Markdown is an importer/exporter and editing surface rather than the sovereign representation.
- CLI workflows, future visual UX, importers, emitters, and infrastructure depend on this structural substrate.
- Documents, revisions, nodes, edges, transactions, and provenance remain canonical kernel concerns.
- Store behavior is not an alternate authority; it persists canonical kernel state, including structural AST data where applicable.
