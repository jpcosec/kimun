# Emitter / compiler

## Answer

An emitter or compiler projects canonical AST structure outward into Markdown, code, text, config, or other derived forms.

## Supporting points

- Emitters turn canonical structure into user-facing outputs.
- They are projection machinery, not the canonical substrate.
- They should remain separable from importers.
