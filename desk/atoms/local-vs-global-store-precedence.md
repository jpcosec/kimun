# Local vs global store precedence

## Answer

A project-local `.sldb/` is the normal workflow location; a global `~/.sldb/` may also exist, and the local store wins when both are present.

## Supporting points

- The docs present local-first precedence as part of normal usage.
- This behavior affects how store-based commands resolve context.
- Users can rely on project-local state taking priority.
