# Reversible document family

## Answer

A reversible document family is one for which the kernel can guarantee canonical semantic round-trip across parse, canonicalize, render, parse, and canonicalize again.

## Supporting points

- The required invariant is `canonicalize(parse(render(C))) == C` for canonical content `C`.
- Byte-for-byte source preservation may be offered by lossless adapters, but semantic reversibility is the required floor.
- Reversible families need deterministic canonicalization, deterministic rendering, and stable node identity rules.
- Reversibility must survive persistence and reload, not only in-memory transforms.
