# Rust core

## Answer

The Rust core is the knowledge kernel that alone enforces canonical data invariants, transactions, revisions, hashing, persistence, and capability-checked effects.

## Supporting points

- Rust is the only authority allowed to produce new revisions.
- Markdown, Lisp, CLI, UI, agents, parsers, and semantic services are projection or adapter surfaces around the kernel rather than alternate authorities.
- The core must stay small enough to verify: types, operations, validation, transaction execution, Merkle hashing, and storage contracts belong here.
- The kernel may expose embedded or daemonized APIs later, but the invariant boundary remains the same.
