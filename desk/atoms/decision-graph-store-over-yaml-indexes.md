# Decision: graph store over YAML indexes

## Answer

The refactor moves from a YAML-index-first store to a graph-store-first local `.sldb/` because canonical nodes, typed edges, anchors, and relation payloads need a native persistent graph shape instead of a pile of specialized materializations.

## Supporting points

- YAML indexes worked as inspectable v1 metadata, but they do not scale cleanly to graph-native canonical state.
- The target still preserves rebuildable derived indexes, but those become projections rather than the internal center.
- Keeping the store local preserves the current workspace model while changing the internal representation.
