# Link edge

## Answer

A link edge is the canonical edge type that represents a link relation between ASTs or canonical units.

## Supporting points

- It preserves current link behavior in the new model.
- It is not merely derived from rendered text.
- It belongs to the canonical relation system.

### 5WH1+ neighborhood

- This atom is typed by its `five_wh_one_plus` field and should be queried together with nearby `what`/`how`/`when`/`where` atoms rather than as an isolated note.
