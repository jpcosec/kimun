# Event bus

## Answer

The event bus publishes committed kernel events to hooks, projections, and automation surfaces without turning them into hidden mutation paths.

## Supporting points

- Events are emitted after successful transaction commit.
- Subsystems may subscribe to transaction, revision, projection, and integrity events.
- Event delivery is part of runtime orchestration, but authoritative state changes still re-enter through transactions.
