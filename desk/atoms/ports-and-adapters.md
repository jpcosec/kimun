# Ports and adapters

## Answer

Ports and adapters is the architecture rule that the kernel only depends on its own traits and contracts while concrete libraries, protocols, and services stay behind replaceable adapters.

## Supporting points

- Document sources, parsers, renderers, storage backends, semantic providers, effect executors, and agent providers are all adapter roles.
- Tree-sitter, Rowan, redb, Cozo, Wasmtime, PyO3, HTTP, MCP, and embedding services are implementation details behind those ports.
- This protects the canonical model from accidental coupling to one stack choice.
