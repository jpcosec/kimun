# Primitive operation

## Answer

A primitive operation is one of the closed kernel mutation forms from which higher-level edits, macros, transforms, and reconciliations must be compiled.

## Supporting points

- The initial closed set is `PutNode`, `RemoveNode`, `PutEdge`, `RemoveEdge`, `SetDocumentRoot`, `AttachArtifact`, and `EmitDomainEvent`.
- Higher-level workflows may be expressive, but they must compile down to primitive operations before validation.
- Closing the operation set keeps transactions inspectable, diffable, and portable across frontends.
