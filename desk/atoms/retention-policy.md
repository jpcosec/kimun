# Retention policy

## Answer

A retention policy defines which revisions, payloads, projections, embeddings, logs, and effects must be kept, may be pruned, or must be pinned.

## Supporting points

- Reachable, pinned, and orphaned state need explicit distinction.
- Retention policy is what makes garbage collection safe instead of destructive guesswork.
- Different storage classes may have different retention horizons.
