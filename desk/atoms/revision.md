# Revision

## Answer

A revision is an immutable document state produced by one committed transaction and identified by a deterministic root hash plus explicit parent lineage.

## Supporting points

- Every mutation yields a new revision rather than changing an existing one.
- A revision records parents, transaction provenance, creation time, and root hash.
- Queries, projections, diffs, merges, and external synchronization must be revision-aware.
- Invalid states such as parse failures may still be recorded as revisions when the system needs auditable failure persistence.
