# Compatibility surface

## Answer

A compatibility surface is the versioned contract that must remain intelligible across kernel evolution for persistence, canonical model, operations, protocols, schemas, projections, or plugins.

## Supporting points

- Compatibility should be versioned by surface, not assumed to share one global version.
- Persisted format, canonical model, operation semantics, and external protocols may evolve at different rates.
- Compatibility commitments define when migration is required and what kinds of mixed-version interaction are allowed.
