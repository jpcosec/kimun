# Tracked document identity

## Answer

A tracked doc has both a logical store name and a physical file path, and commands may accept tracked name, qualified `Model/name`, or path depending on the command.

## Supporting points

- Tracked docs have a logical identity separate from raw filesystem location.
- This dual identity is part of normal user behavior in store-backed workflows.
- The refactor should preserve a recognizable tracked-document model.
