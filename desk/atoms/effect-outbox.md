# Effect outbox

## Answer

The effect outbox is the persistent queue of approved external actions that must run after commit and report their results back through later transactions.

## Supporting points

- Outboxed effects isolate the kernel from partial writes caused by Git, filesystem, process, network, or agent failures.
- An effect entry should include the requested action plan, capabilities, provenance, and execution status.
- External side effects and their results become auditable kernel history rather than invisible runtime behavior.
