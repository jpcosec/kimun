# Decision kernel authority stays in Clojure

## Answer

The architecture keeps all authoritative mutation, revision, hashing, persistence, and capability validation inside the Clojure kernel. Python, Lisp, CLI, UI, and agents remain clients or metalanguages around that authority.

## Supporting points

- The older Python-orchestration framing is now subordinate to the stronger kernel model.
- Multiple frontends may exist, but none of them may bypass transaction validation or revision production.
- This keeps the smallest correctness-critical surface in one strongly constrained implementation language.
