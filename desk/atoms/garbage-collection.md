# Garbage collection

## Answer

Garbage collection is the controlled process that reclaims unreachable or expired stored state without violating revision integrity, retention guarantees, or provenance requirements.

## Supporting points

- GC must distinguish canonical history from rebuildable caches and derived artifacts.
- Reachability and retention decisions belong to explicit policy, not ad hoc deletion.
- GC should operate over revisions, payloads, projections, embeddings, effects, and caches with different rules.
