# Immutable append-only database

The `GraphStore` and its historical logs (`HistoryArtifacts`) operate in an "Append-Only" and immutable fashion. This design cleanly resolves concurrency issues, as writes do not mutate existing records, ensuring lock-free reads and auditable, incremental state transitions.
