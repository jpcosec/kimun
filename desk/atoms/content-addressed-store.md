# Content-addressed store

## Answer

The content-addressed store persists payloads and derived artifacts under deterministic hashes so content identity stays decoupled from mutable locations.

## Supporting points

- The same canonical bytes should map to the same stored hash key.
- Payload storage supports deduplication, integrity verification, and lazy retrieval.
- Canonical node hashes and revision hashes may reference content-addressed payloads without duplicating them inline.
