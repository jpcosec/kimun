# Threat model

## Answer

The threat model names the adversaries, abuse cases, and failure pressures that the kernel must resist or contain across documents, plugins, hooks, agents, effects, and external integrations.

## Supporting points

- It should cover malicious Lisp, untclojureed plugins, path traversal, prompt injection in documents, resource exhaustion, recursive hooks, and data leakage.
- Threat modeling gives the capability system concrete adversaries instead of abstract permissions only.
- Security claims without an explicit threat model are underspecified.
