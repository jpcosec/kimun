# Anchor sample

## Answer

An anchor sample is the quoted text evidence carried by a text-oriented anchor to support reattachment and drift detection.

## Supporting points

- It is one of the key evidence fields of a text anchor.
- It helps the system detect whether the cited source changed.
- It is not the only anchor field; it works with path, hash, and locator.
