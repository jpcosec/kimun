# Schema Binding

## Answer

Schema binding attaches canonical content to an explicit model or schema contract.

## Supporting points

- Typed models remain first-class entities in the product promise.
- Models and templates must become inspectable entities rather than hidden implementation behavior.
- The AST generalizes Pydantic-style contracts instead of replacing them with untyped structure.
