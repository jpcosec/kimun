# Derived address

## Answer

A derived address is a surface-specific or projection-specific address that resolves back to a canonical address.

## Supporting points

- It supports CLI, rendered documents, and visual projections.
- It is not the sovereign identity of the unit.
- It should resolve back to canonical structure.
