# Kernel API

## Answer

The kernel API is the public authority boundary for opening documents, submitting transactions, running queries, creating projections, and subscribing to kernel events.

## Supporting points

- The same authority surface must be reachable from embedded Rust, Python FFI, local IPC, HTTP, gRPC, UI clients, and agents.
- Public contracts should be typed around document handles, transaction builders, query plans, projection specs, and event streams.
- No client-facing adapter may bypass kernel validation by writing directly to persistence.
