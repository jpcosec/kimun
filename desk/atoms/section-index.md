# Section index

## Answer

The section index is the retrieval component that organizes section-level canonical structure for navigation, querying, and inspection.

## Supporting points

- It supports deeper navigation than whole-document access.
- It should be derived from canonical structure.
- It belongs to retrieval infrastructure rather than document truth.

### 5WH1+ neighborhood
