# Failure model

## Answer

The failure model classifies kernel and adapter failures into stable categories so recovery, retries, user reporting, and corruption handling follow explicit rules.

## Supporting points

- At minimum it distinguishes recoverable error, permanent error, conflict, degraded mode, and corruption.
- Failure handling must cover parser, transaction, persistence, renderer, hook, agent, Git, and process-crash paths.
- Failure categories are part of the product contract, not just logging detail.
