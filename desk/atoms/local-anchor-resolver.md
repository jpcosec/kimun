# Local anchor resolver

## Answer

The local anchor resolver maps local selectors, fragments, and anchors to canonical nodes inside the current document space.

## Supporting points

- It resolves intra-document targeting.
- It supports links, navigation, and editor inspection.
- It should rely on canonical selectors rather than raw text positions alone.
