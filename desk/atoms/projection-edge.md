# Projection edge

## Answer

A projection edge is the canonical edge type that connects a canonical unit to one of its derived outputs, materializations, or projection artifacts.

## Supporting points

- It helps track which derived views come from which canonical source.
- It belongs to the graph-native runtime model.
- It supports explainable projection lineage.
