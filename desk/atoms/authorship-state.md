# Authorship State

## Answer

Authorship state distinguishes authored canonical content from derived canonical content.

## Supporting points

- The design requires authored-versus-derived status as a semantic distinction.
- Reversibility, extraction, rendering, and validation behavior depend on this distinction.
- CLI and visual inspection both need to expose whether a value is authored or derived.
