# Semantic export boundary

## Answer

`stores semantic-export` emits SLDB-owned semantic document truth for graph consumers, while downstream systems add workflow-specific and code-dependency edges.

## Supporting points

- This defines the boundary of what SLDB exports semantically.
- The contract is about ownership of semantic truth, not downstream enrichment.
- The refactor should preserve this boundary even if export internals evolve.
