# Temporal layer

## Answer

The temporal layer represents validity windows, revision timing, and time-aware lineage around canonical units.

## Supporting points

- It extends provenance into explicit time semantics.
- It supports reconstruction and historical reasoning.
- It belongs to canonical-adjacent runtime semantics.
