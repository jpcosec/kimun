# Semantic role

## Answer

A semantic role is the explicit semantic classification of what a canonical unit does or means within a structured semantic view.

## Supporting points

- Roles are finer-grained than generic tags.
- They can support richer semantic navigation later.
- They should not force a broader semantic baseline now.
