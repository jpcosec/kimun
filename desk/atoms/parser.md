# Parser

## Answer

A parser is the adapter-facing component that converts external bytes into a syntax tree suitable for deterministic canonicalization.

## Supporting points

- Parsers are replaceable by document family and media type.
- Parser output is not the persistent truth model.
- Parsers may preserve errors and partial structure so invalid documents remain auditable.
