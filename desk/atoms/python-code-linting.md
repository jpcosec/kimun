# Python code linting

## Answer

Python code linting keeps the CLI and orchestration layers readable, unsurprising, and aligned with the target architecture.

## Supporting points

- It should reduce command-surface clutter, routing sprawl, duplicated helpers, and hidden workflow logic.
- It should preserve a clean user-facing shell over the deeper core refactor.
- It is a clean-code dimension specialized for the Python surfaces.
