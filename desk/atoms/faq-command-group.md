# `faq` command group

## Answer

The `faq` command group is the CLI onboarding surface that answers first-use contract questions about stores, models, docs, search, and tracking.

## Supporting points

- It is a behavior-discovery surface rather than a core runtime component.
- It externalizes stable user-facing definitions from the docs.
- It supports adoption and contract clarity.
