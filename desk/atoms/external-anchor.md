# External Anchor

## Answer

An external anchor is an evidence-backed canonical attachment to content outside the local document.

## Supporting points

- External anchoring is separate from local tree structure and must be modeled explicitly.
- Durable external anchors require locator data, sampled text or context, and content fingerprint evidence.
- Reattachment policy and confidence belong to the anchoring concept because external targets can drift.
