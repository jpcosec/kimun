# Dependency edge

## Answer

A dependency edge is the canonical edge type that expresses structural, projection, or recomputation dependency between canonical units.

## Supporting points

- It supports incremental rebuild and invalidation.
- It is part of the graph-native runtime model.
- It helps connect canonical structure to derived infrastructure.
