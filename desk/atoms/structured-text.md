# Structured text

## Answer

Structured text is human-readable text whose parts have stable boundaries, recognizable roles, and interpretable relationships, so the same document can remain readable for people while also being operable by the canonical SLDB architecture.

## Supporting points

- Structure includes headings, sections, lists, tables, metadata blocks, links, anchors, and stronger typed field structures when a document family provides them.
- Without structure, composition collapses into string concatenation and addressability becomes fragile.
- Structured text is important even after the refactor because Markdown remains a major authoring and projection surface.
- Structured text lives at the document surface and must map cleanly into the canonical AST rather than competing with it.
