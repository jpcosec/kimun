# Semantic exporter

## Answer

The semantic exporter emits SLDB-owned semantic document truth for downstream graph or semantic consumers without taking ownership of their downstream edges.

## Supporting points

- It is the operational component behind the semantic export boundary.
- It should export canonical-derived semantics plus provenance.
- It should not absorb downstream workflow-specific semantics.
