# Decision: relation AST extensibility

## Answer

Relations carry extensible relation-AST payloads because thin fixed edges would make the graph model too rigid for evolving link semantics, store semantics, provenance, and future plugin behavior.

## Supporting points

- The target ontology treats relations as first-class structures, not just anonymous connectors.
- Extensible relation payloads reduce pressure to bloat the base node schema.
- This keeps the graph-native substrate open to richer behaviors without rewriting the whole persistence model.
