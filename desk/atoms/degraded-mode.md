# Degraded mode

## Answer

Degraded mode is the explicit runtime state where the kernel remains usable for a bounded subset of operations while one capability, index, provider, or adapter surface is unavailable or intentionally disabled.

## Supporting points

- Degraded mode is not silent corruption and not full health.
- The active restrictions must be observable to users and clients.
- Rebuildable services such as indexes, embeddings, or projections may degrade independently from canonical revision integrity.
