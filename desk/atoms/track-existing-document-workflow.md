# Track existing document workflow

## Answer

Use the track existing document workflow when a Markdown file already exists and must be validated and registered into the store.

## Supporting points

- It starts from an authored file rather than from payload data.
- It is the bridge from existing documents into tracked project state.
- It preserves the v1 document lifecycle distinction.
