# Testing

## Answer

Testing is the validation dimension that must cover both unit-level correctness and UX-level behavior for the refactored SLDB system.

## Supporting points

- Unit testing proves the contracts of AST structure, field binding, links, projections, and store-facing behavior.
- UX testing proves the recognizable behavior of CLI workflows and future visual interactions.
- This dimension lets the knowledge base connect implementation structure with observable product validation.
