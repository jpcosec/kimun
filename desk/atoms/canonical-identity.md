# Canonical Identity

## Answer

Durable document, node, and field units need stable canonical identity inside the model.

## Supporting points

- The AST explicitly carries stable document and node identity.
- Field-aware semantics require identity that persists across extraction, rendering, linking, and recomputation.
- Provenance, hashes, anchors, and projections depend on stable identity.
