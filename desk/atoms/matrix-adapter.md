# Matrix adapter

## Answer

The Matrix adapter is the bridge that can project canonical nodes, fields, and relations into a proposition-oriented semantic engine without making that engine the canonical document model.

## Supporting points

- It is a future semantic integration path.
- It should consume derived semantic facts or propositions from canonical structure.
- It belongs to semantic infrastructure and adapters, not the AST core itself.
