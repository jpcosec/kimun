# How to get data out of SLDB

## Answer

SLDB exposes different outputs for different levels: `extract` for one-file payloads, `docs show` for tracked docs, `fields` for field values, `find` for retrieval, `ast show` for normalized inspection, and `stores semantic-export` for bulk graph handoff.

## Supporting points

- The product exposes multiple read surfaces rather than one universal output command.
- Each surface serves a different granularity of access.
- This behavior should remain legible after the refactor.

### 5WH1+ neighborhood

- This atom is typed by its `five_wh_one_plus` field and should be queried together with nearby `what`/`how`/`when`/`where` atoms rather than as an isolated note.
