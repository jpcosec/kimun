# Snapshots

## Answer

Snapshots are durable captured states of canonical structure or derived runtime state used for reconstruction, comparison, and temporal workflows.

## Supporting points

- They support historical reconstruction beyond a single current state.
- They belong beside the AST as infrastructure.
- They work with provenance and event history.
