# Decision embedded FFI is optional, not sovereign

## Answer

An embedded FFI such as PyO3 may exist for Python clients, but it is an adapter choice rather than the defining architecture boundary.

## Supporting points

- The governing public boundary is the kernel API and its transaction/query/projection contracts.
- Embedded FFI is useful for low-overhead local integration, but the same kernel semantics must also support non-Python clients.
- No adapter is allowed to redefine storage, revision, or capability behavior.
