# Semantic reference

## Answer

A semantic reference is a semantic-layer link from one canonical unit or concept-bearing unit to another.

## Supporting points

- It is not the same as an ordinary document link.
- It belongs to the semantic relation layer.
- It is useful for richer future navigation and export.
