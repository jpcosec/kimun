# What a store is

## Answer

A store is SLDB's metadata workspace for models, tracked docs, integrity, and indexes; it does not replace Markdown files or become the text source of truth.

## Supporting points

- The store holds metadata about documents rather than the documents themselves.
- The store is part of the workflow experience but not the canonical text layer.
- This external contract should survive even if store internals change.
