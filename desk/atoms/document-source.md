# Document source

## Answer

A document source is the external origin interface through which the kernel identifies, reads, and optionally writes document content.

## Supporting points

- Filesystem, Git, and HTTP are source implementations rather than canonical models.
- Source metadata may provide cheap change hints, but canonical confirmation must come from content and hashing.
- Source adapters must stay behind kernel-defined traits.
