# tree-sitter adapter

## Answer

The tree-sitter adapter uses syntax-aware parsing or projection for code-facing surfaces without becoming the sovereign model of the system.

## Supporting points

- tree-sitter is useful for code-oriented parsing and projection.
- It should remain downstream of canonical structure.
- It is an adapter for code surfaces, not the main document ontology.
