# Decision: links and anchors are canonical

## Answer

Links and anchors are modeled as canonical parts of the target system because they are core addressability and relation primitives, not cosmetic render artifacts.

## Supporting points

- Current and future linking behavior needs stable identity independent of one renderer.
- External anchoring requires explicit canonical payload such as path, hash, sample, and locator data.
- Canonicalizing links and anchors keeps graph projection, inspection, and visual tooling aligned to one truth model.
