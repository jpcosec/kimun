# Corruption state

## Answer

Corruption state is the explicit condition where canonical persistence invariants can no longer be tclojureed without repair, replay, or restoration.

## Supporting points

- Corruption is stronger than ordinary failure or degraded mode.
- It must trigger verify, recover, or restore flows rather than normal mutation.
- Rebuildable caches may be discarded, but corruption of canonical logs, revisions, heads, or required payloads is a first-class incident.
