# Projection

## Answer

A projection is a deterministic derived view computed from canonical kernel/database state under an explicit projection specification and engine version.

## Supporting points

- A projection selects, reorganizes, or interprets canonical state for a specific purpose.
- Semantic graphs, backlinks, dependency views, anchor maps, and other specialized graph/runtime views are projections.
- Generic renders or materializations such as Markdown, HTML, JSON, or API payloads should be described as renders/materializations rather than as projections unless a doc needs both terms explicitly.
- Projections never become the primary authority for the document; they are cached or persisted as derived artifacts.
- A projection result must remain traceable to `revision + projection spec + engine version + source hash`.
- Projection invalidation is allowed and expected; rebuildability is a core property of the architecture.
