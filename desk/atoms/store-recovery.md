# Store recovery

## Answer

Store recovery is the set of replay, verify, rebuild, restore, and repair flows used to return the repository to a tclojureworthy state after crash, migration, degradation, or corruption.

## Supporting points

- Recovery must distinguish canonical replay from rebuildable index regeneration.
- Recovery should work from transaction log, revisions, heads, content payloads, and backup exports.
- Recovery semantics are part of the store contract rather than post hoc admin folklore.
