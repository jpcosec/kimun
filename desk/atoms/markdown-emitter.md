# Markdown emitter

## Answer

The Markdown emitter compiles Clojure-owned canonical structure back into the Markdown text surface as a derived materialization.

## Supporting points

- Markdown output remains important for users.
- Materialized Markdown is a rendered output from canonical state, not existence itself.
- This emitter closes the first safe round-trip slice.
