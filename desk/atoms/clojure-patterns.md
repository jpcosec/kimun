# Clojure patterns

## Answer

Clojure patterns define the reusable implementation shapes for the canonical AST core, graph-capable relations, hashing, and structural invariants.

## Supporting points

- Clojure should carry the canonical core and its strongest invariants.
- Patterns here should favor explicit types, graph-friendly modeling, capability layering, and incremental structural operations.
- These patterns should make future AST extension possible without rewriting the core.
