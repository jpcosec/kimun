# Field Binding

## Answer

Field binding connects canonical structure to typed document-model semantics.

## Supporting points

- The refactor preserves the original SLDB promise around typed models rather than abandoning it.
- One or more AST nodes may bind to typed fields without making field contracts the only structure.
- Extraction, rendering, validation, reversibility, and composition depend on explicit field binding.

### 5WH1+ neighborhood

- This atom is typed by its `five_wh_one_plus` field and should be queried together with nearby `what`/`how`/`when`/`where` atoms rather than as an isolated note.
