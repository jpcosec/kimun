# Create document workflow

## Answer

Use the create document workflow when the canonical input is payload data and SLDB should materialize a new document from that data.

## Supporting points

- It renders a new document instead of validating an existing one.
- It belongs to the document lifecycle surface.
- It should preserve the current user mental model in the refactor.
