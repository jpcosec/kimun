# External anchor resolver

## Answer

The external anchor resolver uses evidence, locators, text samples, and fingerprints to reattach references to content outside the local canonical document.

## Supporting points

- It handles drift-prone external targets.
- It should combine selector logic with anchoring evidence.
- It is distinct from local address resolution.
