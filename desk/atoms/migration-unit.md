# Migration unit

## Answer

A migration unit is the smallest versioned surface that can be upgraded, replayed, transformed, or verified independently during system evolution.

## Supporting points

- Examples include store format, canonical schema, command protocol, projection cache, or plugin contract.
- Migration units should be explicit so recovery and compatibility work can be scoped precisely.
- Migrations must not silently rewrite kernel meaning outside the declared unit.
