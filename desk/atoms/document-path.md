# Document path

## Answer

A document path is the source-path field carried by an anchor so the system knows which external document or file the anchor refers to.

## Supporting points

- It is mandatory for external anchoring.
- It complements locators and hashes.
- It is not sufficient by itself to guarantee attachment stability.
