# Source locator

## Answer

A source locator is the pointer mechanism used to identify where an anchor targets content in a source document or artifact.

## Supporting points

- Its concrete form depends on document family.
- It may point by text span, AST path, page, DOM location, syntax node, or similar.
- It is a core part of anchoring behavior.
