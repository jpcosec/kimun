# Transaction

## Answer

A transaction is the only authorized unit of mutation: a validated, ordered set of primitive operations applied against a base revision to produce a new revision.

## Supporting points

- Transactions carry actor identity, base revision, required capabilities, and the operations to stage.
- Validation must happen before commit, including type checks, invariants, and conflict checks.
- A transaction appends to the log, writes revision state, updates document head, and emits events atomically.
- External effects are never executed inside the transaction itself.
