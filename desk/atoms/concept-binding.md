# Concept binding

## Answer

A concept binding connects a canonical unit to an explicit semantic concept in a structured semantic layer.

## Supporting points

- It is a richer semantic relation than a loose tag.
- It may support future semantic integrations.
- It remains secondary to the current explicit-tag baseline.
