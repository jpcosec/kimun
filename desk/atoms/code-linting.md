# Code linting

## Answer

Code linting is the clean-code dimension that keeps the refactor readable, constrained, low-clutter, and structurally aligned with the intended architecture.

## Supporting points

- This dimension is about architectural cleanliness, naming, duplication control, and surface clarity, not only formatter output.
- It should prevent accidental complexity from reappearing between the AST core, projections, store infrastructure, and CLI surfaces.
- It gives the knowledge base a way to connect product cleanliness expectations with implementation review criteria.
