# Fragment id

## Answer

A fragment id is a stable fragment-level address token for a meaningful canonical unit inside a document or projection space.

## Supporting points

- It gives fine-grained targeting beyond whole-document identity.
- It should survive through stable structural conventions where possible.
- It belongs to the canonical addressability layer.
