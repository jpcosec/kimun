# Document tracker

## Answer

The document tracker registers and maintains the relationship between canonical documents, logical tracked identities, and physical file artifacts.

## Supporting points

- It connects logical and physical document handles.
- It is a store-facing operational component.
- It should preserve the tracked-document contract across refactors.
