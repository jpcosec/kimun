# Lisp macro language

## Answer

The Lisp macro language is an authored input surface used to express reusable functional behavior that lowers into kernel-validated plans rather than mutating canonical state directly.

## Supporting points

- Macros are for functionality, composition, and reuse.
- Macro expansion does not bypass Rust-owned validation, typing, capability checks, or transaction rules.
- Authored macro forms are inputs; any later emitted Lisp representation from canonical state is a materialization.
- Macro forms should be translatable or hostable by other surfaces without changing kernel authority.
