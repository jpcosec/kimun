# Transaction log

## Answer

The transaction log is the append-only persistent record of every committed kernel transaction.

## Supporting points

- Past transactions are never edited in place.
- The log is one of the sources of truth from which indexes, caches, and some projections may be rebuilt.
- Recovery after crash must be defined in terms of replayable committed log entries and consistent revision/head state.
