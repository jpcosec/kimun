# CLI Workflow Surface

## Answer

The CLI workflow surface is the terminal-facing operating surface that must remain recognizable across the refactor.

## Supporting points

- CLI continuity is an explicit product constraint even while internals change deeply.
- The recognizable SLDB command family should survive with reduced clutter and cleaner implementation.
- The CLI is a consumer of the canonical substrate rather than an independent truth source.
