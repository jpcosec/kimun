# Lisp metalanguage

## Answer

Lisp is a projection language around the Rust kernel for expressing schemas, macros, queries, transforms, rules, and effects, but it is not an authority that mutates persistence directly.

## Supporting points

- Lisp expressions must compile to `TransactionPlan`, `QueryPlan`, `ProjectionPlan`, or `EffectPlan` before execution.
- Lisp may also carry schema and functional forms as projection surfaces around kernel meaning.
- The kernel validates compiled plans against types, invariants, and capabilities.
- This preserves extensibility without turning macros into a hidden privileged persistence API.
