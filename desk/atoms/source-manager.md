# Source manager

## Answer

The source manager coordinates external source inspection, change detection, parser invocation, canonicalization, reconciliation, and transaction submission for tracked content.

## Supporting points

- It is responsible for on-demand synchronization rather than daemon-only observation.
- Metadata timestamps may be used as cheap hints, but canonical content decides whether state changed.
- Source reconciliation must compile differences into primitive operations and transactions.
