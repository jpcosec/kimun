# Storage backend

## Answer

A storage backend is the replaceable persistence adapter that implements the kernel repository contracts for logs, revisions, heads, and content-addressed payloads.

## Supporting points

- redb, Cozo, and in-memory stores are backend strategies, not kernel identity.
- Storage contracts must preserve atomic commit, replayability, and revision integrity.
- Backend swaps must not change canonical hashing or transaction semantics.
