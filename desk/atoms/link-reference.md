# Link Reference

## Answer

A link reference is a typed canonical relation from one unit to another target.

## Supporting points

- Links move out of ad hoc string behavior and into explicit canonical structure.
- Link relations need target identity, resolution state, and provenance.
- Graph-friendly navigation and semantic projection depend on links being first-class relations.
