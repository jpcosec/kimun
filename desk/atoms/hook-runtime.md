# Hook runtime

## Answer

The hook runtime interprets hook bindings over committed kernel events and turns approved actions into outboxed effects rather than mutating the graph inline.

## Supporting points

- Hooks run after transactions, not inside them.
- A hook may produce an `ActionPlan`, but execution of filesystem, Git, network, tool, or agent actions must happen through an effect outbox.
- Effect results re-enter the kernel as later transactions so failure cannot leave the canonical graph half-written.
- Capability checks belong to the hook/effect path before any external action is executed.
