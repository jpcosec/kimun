# Hook Binding

## Answer

A hook binding is a declarative canonical record of executable behavior attached to nodes or fields.

## Supporting points

- Hooks must be describable in the AST even when execution happens outside the core runtime.
- Input contract, output contract, execution policy, and verification expectations are part of the durable concept.
- Making hooks explicit avoids hiding behavior inside ad hoc implementation code.
