# Append-only event log

## Answer

The append-only event log records canonical changes over time as durable system-level history beyond git alone.

## Supporting points

- It tracks what changed, when, and through which transformation path.
- It supports reconstructable lineage and temporal workflows.
- It is a history infrastructure component, not a user-facing projection.
