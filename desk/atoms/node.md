# Node

## Answer

A node is the primary canonical entity stored inside a document revision, carrying stable identity, a type, payload references, and metadata.

## Supporting points

- Nodes are revisioned through transactions, not edited in place.
- Nodes participate in multiple edge semantics: structural ownership, reference, semantic, and derived relations.
- Stable node identity matters for reconciliation, provenance, projections, and targeted transforms.
- Node payloads may be canonical content or references to stored artifacts, but node identity cannot collapse into adapter-specific handles.
