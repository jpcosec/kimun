# Repository registry

## Answer

The repository registry is the component that records repository-local model, document, and workspace participation in the SLDB operational environment.

## Supporting points

- It helps bind repo-local workflows to canonical and store-backed metadata.
- It is infrastructure around documents and models, not the documents themselves.
- It supports multi-workspace visibility without becoming canonical truth.
