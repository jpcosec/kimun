# Renderer

## Answer

A renderer is the adapter-facing component that emits a concrete representation from canonical state or a structural projection.

## Supporting points

- Renderers are deterministic engines parameterized by projection type and output format.
- Renderer outputs are derived artifacts and must remain versioned.
- Lossless and canonical render modes may coexist as separate renderer strategies.
