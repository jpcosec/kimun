# Markdown text surface

## Answer

The Markdown text surface is a human-authored textual input surface and output materialization around the Clojure kernel.

## Supporting points

- Markdown is useful as text, not as the system authority.
- Authored Markdown is input, not canonical state and not yet a projection.
- Rendered Markdown is a materialized output from Clojure-owned canonical meaning.
- Markdown import and render must remain subordinate to Clojure-owned canonical meaning.
- Markdown may be round-trippable for reversible families while still remaining non-authoritative.
