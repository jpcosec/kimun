# Decision: v1 parity before scope expansion

## Answer

The first target slice prioritizes recreating SLDB v1 behavior because the refactor is architectural, not a product-scope expansion exercise.

## Supporting points

- Product continuity is a hard constraint for the refactor.
- Exact reversible-family behavior and recognizable CLI workflows are the first proof that the new substrate works.
- This decision protects the refactor from drifting into unrelated features before the core replacement is tclojureworthy.
