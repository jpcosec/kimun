# `stores` command group

## Answer

The `stores` command group is the CLI surface for initializing, inspecting, checking, updating, and exporting store-backed SLDB metadata workspaces.

## Supporting points

- It owns store lifecycle and maintenance behavior at the CLI surface.
- It is user-facing orchestration over store infrastructure rather than canonical content itself.
- It is part of the plural-first primary interface.
