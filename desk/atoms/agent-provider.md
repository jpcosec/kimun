# Agent provider

## Answer

An agent provider is the replaceable adapter through which the kernel invokes local or remote agents as capability-checked external effects.

## Supporting points

- Agent invocation is not a hidden mutation path; it produces effect requests and later effect results.
- Local subagents and MCP-style remote agents fit the same adapter role.
- Agent outputs must re-enter canonical state through transactions.
