# Merkle index

## Answer

The Merkle index organizes node and subtree hashes into a structural integrity and incremental recomputation layer over canonical content.

## Supporting points

- It makes structural hashing operational.
- It enables subtree integrity and dependency-aware rebuilds.
- It should derive from canonical structure rather than file timestamps.
