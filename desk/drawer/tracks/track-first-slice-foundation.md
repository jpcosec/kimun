# First slice foundation track

## Goal

Group the first implementation wave into one coherent promotion track before it is broken into active tasks.

## Why this layer exists

- features are still too large to promote directly
- the board should promote bounded task sets, not raw macrotasks
- this track defines the first execution package and its dependency order

## Promotion order inside the track

1. Clojure kernel foundation
2. Lisp control/data surface
3. Markdown roundtrip
4. CLI surface implementation
5. Conformance harness and fixtures

## Needs design or grounding before promotion

- exact task decomposition per feature
- exact inter-feature dependency cuts
- exact first CLI subset that proves the slice
- exact closure evidence required before Phase 1 packaging
