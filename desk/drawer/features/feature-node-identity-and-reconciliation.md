# Node identity and reconciliation

## Goal

Define the macrotask for stable node identity and deterministic reconciliation across repeated imports, edits, and canonical rewrites.

## Includes

- stable identity rules
- reconciliation policy
- merge/update semantics
- canonicalization conflict handling

## Excludes

- distributed collaboration policy
- semantic-provider expansion

## Needs design or grounding before promotion

- exact identity inputs
- duplicate vs same-entity rules
- reconciliation precedence across surfaces
- fixtures for identity stability across edits
