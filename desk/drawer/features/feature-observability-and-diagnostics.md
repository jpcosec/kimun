# Observability and diagnostics

## Goal

Define the macrotask for making system behavior inspectable by operators and product surfaces.

## Includes

- runtime traces
- status/explain outputs
- query/effect diagnostics
- stored observability artifacts where appropriate

## Excludes

- observability that silently changes authority
- UI-only assumptions

## Needs design or grounding before promotion

- exact status/explain surface
- retention policy for traces/logs
- redaction/privacy boundaries
- operator workflows for diagnosis
