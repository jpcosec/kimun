# Canonical graph-store hardening

## Goal

Define the macrotask for store verification, recovery, corruption handling, and degraded operation once the first-slice kernel/store foundation exists.

## Includes

- verify/rebuild flows
- corruption detection and classification
- degraded-mode behavior
- operator-visible recovery controls
- store-usable vs store-needs-recovery boundary

## Excludes

- semantic indexing rollout
- product-surface scope expansion unrelated to store integrity

## Needs design or grounding before promotion

- exact verify command surface
- exact rebuild scope for caches, projections, and indexes
- exact corruption-state classification
- exact operator recovery sequence
