# Conformance harness and fixtures

## Goal

Define the macrotask for proving product behavior with fixtures and reference expectations rather than informal confidence.

## Includes

- conformance suite shape
- golden fixtures
- reference behavior policy
- attestation boundaries per feature slice

## Excludes

- vague manual-only validation
- implementation claims without fixture proof

## Needs design or grounding before promotion

- fixture organization
- attestation granularity per subsystem
- cross-surface conformance policy
- reference behavior source hierarchy
