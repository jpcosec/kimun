# CLI surface implementation

## Goal

Define the macrotask for the actual user-facing CLI product surface over the first approved implementation layers.

## Includes

- command-group behavior
- output formats
- direct vs store-backed mode behavior
- help/error/explain UX

## Excludes

- GUI surfaces
- semantic-provider expansion unless separately promoted

## Needs design or grounding before promotion

- promotion order of command groups
- exact first usable CLI subset
- operator diagnostics in CLI form
- acceptance fixtures per command family
