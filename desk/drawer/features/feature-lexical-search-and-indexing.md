# Lexical search and indexing

## Goal

Define the macrotask for exact, lexical, and structural retrieval over canonical content without semantic-provider dependency.

## Includes

- lexical search
- structural search
- rebuildable search indexes
- ranking/explain surface for deterministic search

## Excludes

- embeddings
- LLM-mediated retrieval

## Needs design or grounding before promotion

- exact search modes
- index rebuild triggers
- result explainability
- fixture corpus for search conformance
