# Phase 1 closure package

## Goal

Define what must be simultaneously true to declare Phase 1 closed without hidden scope drift.

## Includes

- closure checklist across core feature lanes
- integrated acceptance bundle
- non-goals for excluded later work
- attestation package shape

## Excludes

- post-Phase-1 expansion work
- vague “close enough” closure claims

## Needs design or grounding before promotion

- exact closure bar by surface
- mandatory fixture bundle
- closure dependency graph
- operator/demo narrative for declaring closure
