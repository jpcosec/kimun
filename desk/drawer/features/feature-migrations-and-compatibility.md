# Migrations and compatibility

## Goal

Define the macrotask for persistence evolution without breaking canonical meaning, recoverability, or supported product surfaces.

## Includes

- compatibility metadata
- migration units
- format/version tracking
- upgrade rules
- downgrade or read-older-data policy

## Excludes

- unrelated feature expansion
- silent breaking schema drift

## Needs design or grounding before promotion

- migration grain and ordering
- compatibility guarantees per surface
- rollback policy
- fixture coverage for migration attestation
