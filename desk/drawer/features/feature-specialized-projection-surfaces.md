# Specialized projection surfaces

## Goal

Define the macrotask for structured derived views over canonical state for focused product and operator use cases.

## Includes

- semantic graph views
- dependency trees
- task views
- anchor maps
- agent subgraphs

## Excludes

- generic renders/materializations
- authority reassignment away from canonical state

## Needs design or grounding before promotion

- projection catalog and naming
- cacheability/rebuild policy
- capability boundaries per projection
- explainability for projected views
