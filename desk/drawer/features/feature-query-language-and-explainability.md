# Query language and explainability

## Goal

Define the macrotask for query authoring, plan visibility, explain surfaces, and inspection/debug UX over canonical state.

## Includes

- query surface contract
- explain/debug outputs
- plan inspection
- operator-visible query reasoning

## Excludes

- embeddings-first retrieval
- unrelated GUI work

## Needs design or grounding before promotion

- exact first nontrivial query language surface
- explain output shape
- query safety/capability policy
- how lexical vs structural vs semantic retrieval are separated
