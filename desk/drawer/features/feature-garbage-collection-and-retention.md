# Garbage collection and retention

## Goal

Define the macrotask for keeping what must persist, pruning what may be rebuilt, and protecting pinned history correctly.

## Includes

- retention roots and pins
- GC policy
- pruning rules for payloads, caches, projections, and indexes
- safety rules around canonical history

## Excludes

- backup/import behavior beyond retention interaction
- semantic-provider rollout

## Needs design or grounding before promotion

- canonical reachability rules
- what may be pruned vs must be retained
- scheduling and operator controls
- attestation for safe pruning
