# ProseMirror editor surface

## Goal

Define the macrotask for a ProseMirror-backed authored editor surface that remains subordinate to kernel-owned canonical state.

## Includes

- editor-state import/export boundary
- mapping between editor selections and canonical anchors/selectors
- transaction path from editor edits into kernel-controlled updates
- materialization policy from canonical state back into editor-consumable structure

## Excludes

- treating editor state as canonical authority
- assuming editor transactions bypass kernel validation

## Must stay true

- editor state is authored input or rendered materialization, not authority
- canonical meaning and revision truth stay in the Clojure kernel/database layer
- editor selections must align with stable anchor and selector rules

## Needs design or grounding before promotion

- exact schema boundary between ProseMirror documents and canonical structures
- selection/anchor mapping rules
- collaborative/editor plugin assumptions, if any
- fixture corpus for edit stability and render fidelity
