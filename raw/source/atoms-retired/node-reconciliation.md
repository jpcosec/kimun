# Node reconciliation

## Answer

Node reconciliation is the process that matches external-source changes against canonical identity rules and compiles the result into primitive operations instead of blindly replacing whole documents.

## Supporting points

- It decides whether a unit is unchanged, modified, moved, removed, or recreated.
- Reconciliation must preserve identity where the rules permit it and mint new identity where they do not.
- The output of reconciliation is a transaction-shaped change set, not ad hoc source patching.
