# Document

## Answer

A document is the stable canonical unit whose evolving states are recorded as immutable revisions over a graph of typed nodes and edges.

## Supporting points

- A document is not identical to one source file or one renderer output.
- A document may have an external source reference, but the kernel persists canonical structure, revision lineage, and derived artifacts separately from that source.
- Documents are the unit for heads, history, conflict detection, projections, and provenance.
- Invalid or partially parsed documents must still be representable so failures become auditable state rather than lost input.
